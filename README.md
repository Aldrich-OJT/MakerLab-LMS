# MakerLab - LMS

## Description

This project is a learning management system designed for A2K Academy. In the application, 
the admin will be able to create, update, and delete lessons and quizzes for the users of the application. 
On the other hand, the users are the students who can access the learning materials uploaded 
by the admins for learning purposes. They are also able to take assessments on the lessons 
to gain a badge once they pass and finish a course.
